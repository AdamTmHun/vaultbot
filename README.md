# VaultBot
I made this bot for a server, but I made it open source to help others developing.

# Information
This was made with [repl.it](https://repl.it/), so it has features like database and other stuff built in. If you see some code which has no package listed below, that means it is a built-in feature.

# Packages
Packages that are a __must__ in order this bot to run:
```
discord.js
```
Packages that are not important, just for always on on repl.it and other stuff
```
express
```
